# stress-diagnosis-neural-networks

Can a computer tell how stressed you are? Develop a neural network to diagnose individual stress levels by measuring physiological responses. Think machine-learning psychologist. Then, the results of the algorithm will be compared to diagnoses from a clinician to determine the accuracy of the algorithm's stress diagnosis.
I have uploaded the code but data set could not be uploaded because of large size. It can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qiriro/swell-heart-rate-variability-hrv
