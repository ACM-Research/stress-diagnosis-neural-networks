# stress-diagnosis-neural-networks

Can a computer tell how stressed you are? Develop a neural network to diagnose individual stress levels by measuring physiological responses. Think machine-learning psychologist. Then, the results of the algorithm will be compared to diagnoses from a clinician to determine the accuracy of the algorithm's stress diagnosis.
